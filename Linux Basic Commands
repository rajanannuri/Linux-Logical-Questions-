Modern Linux distributions use systemd instead of SysVinit. 
systemd uses the concept of "targets" instead of runlevels to define different states of the system. 
Target configurations are typically found in:
/etc/systemd/system/
/usr/lib/systemd/system/
Some common targets include:

poweroff.target - Equivalent to runlevel 0.
rescue.target - Equivalent to runlevel 1.
multi-user.target - Equivalent to runlevel 3.
graphical.target - Equivalent to runlevel 5.
reboot.target - Equivalent to runlevel 6.

To check the default target in systemd, you can use the following command:

systemctl get-default

To set a different default target, use:

systemctl set-default target_name


For example, to set the graphical target as the default:

sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target

# yum -- yellowdog updater modified 
# rpm -- redhat package manager
# yum remove packagename

# dmesg -D
dmesg | tail -50
journalctl -k -p err -n 50

The dmesg -D command is used to disable the logging of kernel messages to the console. This means that while the kernel continues to log messages internally, they won't be displayed on the console/terminal.
