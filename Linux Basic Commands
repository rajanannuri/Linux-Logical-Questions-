Modern Linux distributions use systemd instead of SysVinit. systemd uses the concept of "targets" instead of runlevels to define different states of the system. Target configurations are typically found in:
/etc/systemd/system/
/usr/lib/systemd/system/
Some common targets include:

poweroff.target - Equivalent to runlevel 0.
rescue.target - Equivalent to runlevel 1.
multi-user.target - Equivalent to runlevel 3.
graphical.target - Equivalent to runlevel 5.
reboot.target - Equivalent to runlevel 6.

To check the default target in systemd, you can use the following command:

systemctl get-default

To set a different default target, use:

systemctl set-default target_name


For example, to set the graphical target as the default:

sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target

# w or who -- who is connected/login in server
