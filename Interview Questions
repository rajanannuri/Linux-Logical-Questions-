 Example : How to switch to run level 3, we can use below command
      init 3
	  
	New operating system services now using , Systemd Init System:
	
	Systemd init system:
	
	
	1) For current runlevel command or changing the default runlevel
	  systemctl get-default or
	  systemctl default multi-user.target
	The following are the runlevels,
	1) poweroff.target  :- HALT
	2) rescue.target    :- Single-user mode
	3) multi-user.target :- Multi-usermode with networking
	4) graphical.target :-  Multi-user mode with graphical interface

	To exclude package at the time of package

       # unmount the lv/mount point using umount command
	   #organaise the data in lv/mount point by using e2fsck command
	   #e2fsck -f /dev/vgname/lvname
	   #update the file system by using resize2fs command
	   #resize2fs /dev/vgname/lvname
	   #Now reduce the size by using below command
	   #lvreduce -L -200M /dev/vgname/lvname
	   # By using df -hT we can see the chages
	   
18) Which command shows system load average and uptime command shows load average of the system and we can see total 3 values of load average and is there any specific meaning for these values.
